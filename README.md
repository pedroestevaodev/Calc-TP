This project was developed as part of the **Programming Techniques I** course in the Computer Science program. The application is a basic **calculator**, built using the **Unity Engine**, with the goal of applying fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), programming logic, and graphical user interface development.

## Features

The calculator includes the following basic operations:

- **Addition**: Sum of two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Difference between two numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Product of two numbers.
- **Division**: Quotient of two numbers (with division by zero handling).
- **Reset**: Clears values and resets the interface.

### Extra Features

In addition to the basic operations, the project includes:

- **Graphical User Interface (UI)**: Developed in Unity with buttons and dynamic displays to show numbers and operation results.
- **Error Handling**: Validation of invalid input and prevention of impossible operations (such as division by zero).
- **Modular Code**: Organized into separate scripts for operations and UI control, following good OOP practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine**: Main tool used for project development.
- **C#**: Programming language used to write the calculator scripts.
- **Unity UI**: UI system used for buttons and calculator display.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedroestevaodev/unity-calc-tp.git

2. Open the project in Unity:
   - Open Unity Hub.
   - Click "Add" and navigate to the cloned project folder.

3. Open the main scene:
   - Navigate to the **Assets/Scenes** directory.
   - Open the **SampleScene** scene.

## How to Use

1. Run the project in Unity by clicking **Play**.
   
2. Use the graphical interface to input numbers and perform operations.
   - Click the number buttons to enter values.
   - Use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
   - The **C** button clears the screen and resets the calculator.

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided an opportunity to apply concepts learned in the **Programming Techniques I** course, such as:
- Implementing basic algorithms in **C#**.
- Manipulating graphical interfaces using **Unity UI**.
- Using Unity as a tool for building non-game applications.
- Applying **OOP** concepts to modularize code and improve project maintainability.
